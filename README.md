Textile wastewater: What benefits does the photocatalytic degradation of dye offer for the removal of synthetic dyes from wastewater?

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional conventional processes in treatment of textile wastewater. Photocatalytic degradation of synthetic dyes and organic pollutants in wastewater using TiO2/UV and using Nano photocatalysts have been discussed.
